I just built a simple cost saving calculator for businesses.

The idea is to help entrepreneurs quickly see how much they could save with smarter processes or design decisions.

Itâ€™s a small project, but it ties together what I enjoy most: design, development, and driving real business outcomes.

Want to test it out?
